description: The classic, most iconic skate deck. <br><br> I consider this the control group, as a frame of reference for everything else in this project.
steps: I measured my preferred skateboards I've owned and made a <special>schematic</special> of what I'd ideally want in a classic popsicle deck.<br><br> Using bending plys from the Parsons woodshop, I <special>cut them down</special> to be slightly oversized at <special>9" x 34."</special><br><br> For the deck art, I decided to silkscreen a <special>graphic</special> onto the wood. I specifically chose to print on the flat plys because it's easier to print on before molding the deck to it's nose and tail shape.
