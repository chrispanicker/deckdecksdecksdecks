title: THE CHAIR?
schematic: ../assets/media/images/schematics/uhhchair.png
description: "An inherited office chair from my sister. <br><br> It did have wheels and could roll without the trucks, but the trucks do add a particularly skate quality to it."

steps: "In the process of planning the Chair deck, I ended up doing <special>this</special> as a temporary seating option while my sister's desk chair was still in recovery.<br><br> I could see <special>'The Chair?'</special> being a fun deck to ride, since the wheels can swivel in any direction. This <special>prototype mockup</special> was still made with duct tape."
