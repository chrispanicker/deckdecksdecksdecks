description: An inherited office chair from my sister. <br><br> It did have wheels and could roll without the trucks, but the trucks do add a particularly "skate" quality to it.

steps: This is a pretty <special>standard desk chair.</special> This belonged to my sister from when she was in undergrad. <br><br> My early plans for this project were using <special>this chair.</special> I took my drill to it, mutilated it, slapped some <special>duct tape and trucks</special> to the bottom, and said, "look! <special>this</special> is gonna be a thesis project!"
